    deterministic report tools already used (and validated) by 'Chat IA'
    console (wizard/domain_chat_mixin.py), instead of chat_ia's default
    generic ask_ai passthrough.

    Deliberately does NOT go through the generic LLMRouter — see
    ai_chat_wizard.py's own docstring for why that path was retired from
    this business flow (LLMRouter never sees a tool's input_schema, only
    its one-line description, so it can't fill in sales_report's
    customer/date_from/group_by correctly).

    Reuses mercas.mcp.domain.chat.mixin's classification/dispatch methods
    directly (they don't touch any wizard-only field), so there is exactly
    one place that knows how to answer a ventas/compras/facturación/stock
    question — the wizard, the debug wizard and Discuss all share it.
